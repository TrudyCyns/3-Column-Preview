## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I learnt how to set border radiuses for different corners of a container.

```css
#sedans {
  border-radius: 10px 10px 0px 0px;
}
```

### Useful resources

- [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/CSSref/css3_pr_border-radius.asp) - This helped me figure out how I could manipulate the border radius. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
